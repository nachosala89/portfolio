      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a highly motivated Software Engineer who loves to face challenges, work collaboratively with others, and learn new technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated as Information System Engineer in college, where I learned the basics of programming, mathematical and algorithmic thinking, software engineering, and project management. Now I built my path on being a remote Full-Stack Developer, focused on the back-end, but with intuition and good taste for the front-end.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have an exceptional growth mindset. I'm a committed team player, always fostering good collaboration environments. I can be very positive and motivate others to achieve their goals too.
